# ResponsivePortfolio

[This is my portfolio,](https://christinakerr.github.io/index.html) which will be a site for me to show off my work to potential employers. The portfolio placeholder images will be filled in as I work on more projects and gain more experience.

I built the layout of this site using bootstrap, particularly their grid system. This allowed me to make the website responsive without the use of media queries.
